# Hero Regeneration Prompt (v1)

Use the locked illustration system below. Do not modify it.

Locked System Block:
- Style: flat vector, clean geometric shapes, crisp edges, no photorealism, no textures, no readability-reducing gradients, no tiny decorative details.
- Measurable constraints: max 15 distinct shapes; minimum element size 3% of canvas height; accent color usage max 10%; red usage only for semantic heat/danger moments.
- Stroke/radius defaults: consistent 2px stroke family; corner radius set limited to 0/8/16/24.
- Composition rules: single focal cluster, subject fills 60-70% of frame, generous outer padding, centered by default, clear silhouette at distance.
- Color rules (do not add colors):
  - bg #121212
  - surface #1C1C1C
  - surfaceAlt #242424
  - text #FFFFFF
  - muted #A3A3A3
  - primary #F97316
  - heat #EF4444
  - success #22C55E
  - danger #DC2626
  - gold #FBBF24

Scene Brief:
Regenerate the Wing Night setup hero illustration with the same core concept: central bowl of wings, controlled flame behind bowl, one hot sauce bottle, and abstract crowd energy shapes. Keep it bold and dramatic, but cleaner and more system-compliant: fewer micro-details, simpler geometry, and stronger silhouette readability.

Asset Type:
hero

Generate 4 composition variations:
A) Symmetrical layout
- Bowl centered, bottle right side, balanced crowd bands left/right.

B) Dynamic diagonal
- Bowl slightly left of center, bottle leans inward from right, flame follows a diagonal energy line.

C) Minimal
- Large geometric forms only, minimal highlights, no decorative sparks except 1-2 semantic heat accents.

D) Energetic but clean
- Strong rhythm and movement cues while still respecting shape count, accent cap, and no tiny details.

Output Requirements:
- Aspect ratio: 16:9
- Size: 1920x1080
- Background: solid #121212
- No text
- No logos
- Keep accents within 10% area total
- Keep red usage semantic heat only
- Do not introduce cyan/blue tones
